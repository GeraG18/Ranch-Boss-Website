They've truly set the standard for excellence in the industry.",
    "t5Comment":"Trailer Sales and I have been a Horizon Trailer dealer in the state of Indiana for over two years now. We originally Took the Horizon Trailer brand on for the Roll Off Dumpster line but as we progressed along, we eventually started to funnel Dump Trailers in and eventually we keep about all of their models now. I believe that the Horizon Trailer brand is one of the top of the line brands in the industry as far as quality and price point. Their customer service from a dealer perspective is great and my sells rep Roger is always on top of getting me what I need. Also, another great thing is I can always reach Benny the owner of Ranch Boss anytime I need something There is no corporate ladder that you have to climb to reach the top to talk to someone that can help you. So if your looking for one of the top of the line trailer brands on the market to add to your dealership I believe that Ranch Boss Should be that Brand.",
    "t6Comment":"Our experience with Horizon has been nothing short of exceptional. The delivery process is always smooth,efficient, and punctual. Thanks to theirreliable service, we never experience delays in receiving trailers, which helps us meet the high demand from our customers. Horizon's professionalism and attention to detail have greatly contributed to the success of our business, allowing us to quickly turn around trailer sales and maintain customer satisfaction. We deeply value our partnership with Horizon and look forward to continuing this productive relationship for many years to come.",
    "t7Comment":"We met Ranch Boss two years ago at NATDA. Since acquiring this relationship our sales and customer base has grownsignificantly. Every department of thiscompany conducts business withcomplete professionalism. Sun City Trailer Sales (before 264 Trailers) anticipates and looks forward to a long relationship.
